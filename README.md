# About
A simple Curriculum Vitae model in LaTeX. Still working on new features!

This project includes:
  - `main.tex`
  - `education.tex`
  - `experience.tex`
  - `skills.tex`
  - `other_activities.tex`

# Requirements
As this model uses a different font called [`Libertine`](http://libertine-fonts.org/), XeLaTeX is needed. :)

To install in Linux, run the following command: 
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex
```
